# bladeacer's Obsidian Snippets Collection
This repository is a collection of CSS snippets for the note taking application Obsidian.

## Why another snippet collection?
There are quite a few snippet collections by the Obsidian community. Here are some of the reasons I decided to make my own:
- I do not really know where to begin to contribute to all of them
- Lack of Style Settings support for snippets (not really necessary most of the time but nice to have)
- I wish to showcase some of the more niche snippets I found or made, especially those from my theme flexcyon.

### Contributing to this repo
You are welcome to contribute to this repository, though do try to follow the exsting format. 
1. E.g. for you have a snippet that you made, create a directory under the `snippets/` directory and add your GitHub/Discord username as a directory. E.g. `./snippets/bladeacer`
2. If it is from your theme, you can create a directory under the `snippets/` directory with the theme's name. E.g. `./snippets/flexcyon`
3. In each directory you create, try to categorise each file appropriately. 
- Generally, each sub-directory should have an markdown file with links and context about the snippets
- You can include author/source in the YAML in the markdown file(s)
  - Additional metadata like license can be added if your snippet has a license other than the MIT License.
  - You can also add metadata for credits, `includes_scss`, `includes_style_settings` (both of which you can use values of true or false, optional field unless you include scss or style settings support)
  - when including scss, do include the compiled css so those without scss installed can use your snippet
- Example formatting can be found [here](./snippets/flexcyon/ascii-art/ascii-art.md).
