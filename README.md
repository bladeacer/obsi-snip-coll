# bladeacer's Obsidian Snippets Collection
This repository is a collection of CSS snippets for the note taking application Obsidian.

## Why another snippet collection?
There are quite a few snippet collections by the Obsidian community. Here are some of the reasons I decided to make my own:
- I do not really know where to begin to contribute to all of them
- Lack of Style Settings support for snippets (not really necessary most of the time but nice to have)
- I wish to showcase some of the more niche snippets I made, especially those for my theme flexcyon.
